# Plugin Template

This template is meant to be use together with the [plugin-core](https://github.com/mariacdadalt/plugin-core) project.

Make sure you change all the following names for the name of your project:
	- plugin-template
	- Plugin Template
	- Plugin\Template

Pay closer attention to the namespaces and the autoload feature in the `composer.json`.
